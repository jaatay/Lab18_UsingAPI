# Lab18_UsingAPI

## About this project
This project is a MVC application that consumes the API from Lab 17. The way it works is each hyperlink on the index page is routed to a method in the API controller. The requests are sent to the API, and data is returned as a JSON object. The object is then displayed as a page.
